a fullstack react framework

- handles route setup & config
- handles req & res
- handles data fetching and submission

two approaches for building nextJs app : Pages router, app router

in react search engine crawlers don't see the page content when they first visit them

name of the component does not matter inside page.jsx file name does

- Routing, Pages & components
- Fetching & sending data
- Styling, Images & Metadat

  it's running on server can be validated by that console logs will be shown in terminals.

redirecting to diff page with anchor tag has a flow it refreshes the page
<a></a> - gets us out of single page application so,
use special component Link from next/link

inside app icon.png used as fat icon shown in tab header. also reserved keywork

[project-structure](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure)
@ in next refers to Root project
we can place components folder out of app directory or add \_ as prefix to ignore for routing

Dynamic routes with squARE BRACKETS AND PASSING identifier in it.

named route/folder have precedense over dynamic names.
imported png as stored as onject so have to access it's src proprty which contains path, but next's Image does'nt require it
